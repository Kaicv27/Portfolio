### About Me!
I grew up in a military family which has taken me to many places across the globe. My journey has led me to explore different interests, and I wouldn't become formally acquainted with computing until my senior year of high school. From then on. I knew computing would be in my future and it was set into motion with my decision to be a Mathematics-Computer Science major at UC San Diego.
