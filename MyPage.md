### About Me!
My name is Kai Velasco, and I am working towards a B.S. in Structural Engineering with a focus in Aerospace Structures at UC San Diego. Extracurricularly, I have taken a keen interest in materials science and am currently researching the replication of plant structures artifically in materials engineering. I am in the process of investigating how porous materials behave in the context of stress tolerance and heat transfer. After undergrad, I plan to pursue an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering.
