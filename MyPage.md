### About Me!
My name is Kai Velasco and I am a Structural Engineering major at UC San Diego's Jacobs School of Engineering. My studies have led me to an interest in aerospace structural design/ mechanics and materials science. Extracurricularly, I study the the facets of organic structures and their employment in materials science and engineering. I believe that materials science and structural engineering can be furthered by mimicking those strucutures seen in nature by way of teaching us how structures must evolve in the face of changing environments to faciliate structural integrity and longevity. By analyzing how organic structures have evolved, we can use these changes to predict sooner how our structures must be engineered to be adaptable in changing environments.
