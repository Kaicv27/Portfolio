### About Me!
I grew up in a military family which has taken me to many places across the globe. My journey has led me to explore different interests, and I wouldn't become formally acquainted with computing until my senior year of high school. From then on, I knew computing would be in my future and it was set into motion with my decision to be a Mathematics-Computer Science major at UC San Diego. During my time at this institution, I began exploring the different sub-disciplines of computer science and I have since been enticed by artifical intelligence and machine learning. My current pursuit is a career in Machine Learning Engineering. I am a member of the *National Society of Black Engineers UCSD*, and the *Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at UCSD*, particularly the *ACM AI* community
