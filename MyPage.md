### About Me!
My name is Kai Velasco and I am majoring in Structural Engineering at UC San Diego. My studies have led me to develop an interest in aerospace structural design/ mechanics and materials science. Extracurricularly, I study the the facets of organic structures and their employment in materials science and engineering. I believe that materials science and structural engineering can be furthered by mimicking those strucutures seen in nature by way of teaching us how structures must evolve in the face of changing environments to faciliate structural integrity and longevity. By analyzing how organic structures have evolved, we can use these changes to predict sooner how our structures must be engineered to be adaptable in changing environments. My belief lies in the philiosophy that good engineering is not looking for the most infallible soltuion to a problem, but chasing after the most adaptable solution that can be built upon and allows for continued development as we observe the results of our solution.
