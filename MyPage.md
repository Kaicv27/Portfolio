## About Me!
My name is Kai Velasco, and I am working towards a B.S. in Structural Engineering in the Aerospace Structures focus sequence at UC San Diego. Outside of the classroom, I have taken a keen interest in materials science; I am currently researching the replication of plant structures artificially in materials engineering for practical and extreme use cases. I am currently investigating how porous materials behave in the context of stress tolerance and heat transfer. After undergrad, I plan to pursue an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering.

1. ### AUTO - Your Personal CAD Assistant
* AUTO is a chatbot that aids its user in computer-aided design. AUTO accompanies a user through their CAD general workflow, getting a feel for what they want to create and using this information to ease the design process and provide tips and tricks for a smooth CAD experience. AUTO ultimately serves to mitigate the often intimidating amount of functionality supplied by CAD software and makes for a more shallow learning curve so that CAD design becomes more accessible to others.
